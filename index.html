        <h2>Background and Education</h2>
        <p> My name is Kyle McCall. I am 25 years old and am originally from The Dalles, Oregon. After graduating high school in 2014 I moved to Eugene, Oregon to attend school. My major at University of Oregon was environmental studies. After a couple of years in this major I realized that it wasn't necessarily what I wanted to do with my life and decided to take a break from school and potentially return if I thought it seemed like the right decision. During this time in Eugene I mostly worked jobs in the restaurant industry which I remained in until now.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Music has been my passion since I was very young. I grew up playing instruments and have always had a knack for rhythm instruments particularly. Towards the end of high school I started producing electronic music which quickly became the biggest aspect of my life and remains so up until this day. For the last six years I have been writing bass music and playing shows or festivals as often as I can, all while working jobs in the service industry to make ends meet. My goal is to continue doing this, but to secure a job as a software developer so I can support my endeavors as a musician while living a more comfortable life and working in a field that challenges me.</p>
